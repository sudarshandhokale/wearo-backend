# WEARO Backend

Rails API backend for WEARO, a consumer AI personal stylist application.

This repository starts as a clean Rails application and ports only generic
infrastructure patterns from SAFEGO. SAFEGO school transport domain code is not
part of this application.

```

## API

Health check:

```text
GET /api/v1/health
```

Metadata:

```text
GET /api/v1/metadata
```

Returns ISO country selections and style profile option lists for clients.
`preferred_city` is free text in Phase 1.

Authentication:

```text
POST   /api/v1/auth/register
POST   /api/v1/auth/login
POST   /api/v1/auth/refresh
POST   /api/v1/auth/logout
DELETE /api/v1/auth/logout
GET    /api/v1/me
PATCH  /api/v1/me
```

Auth endpoints follow the SAFEGO-style response convention:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": null
}
```

Successful register, login, and refresh responses include the JWT in the
`Authorization` response header.

Clothing items:

```text
GET    /api/v1/clothing_items
POST   /api/v1/clothing_items
GET    /api/v1/clothing_items/:id
PATCH  /api/v1/clothing_items/:id
DELETE /api/v1/clothing_items/:id
POST   /api/v1/clothing_items/:id/reanalyze
```

Clothing item images are attached through Active Storage. Image responses return
a signed blob id and a Rails storage proxy path.
